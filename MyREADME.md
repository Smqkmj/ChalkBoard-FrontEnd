#### A Blackboard improvement 

##  About ChalkBoard
ChalkBoard is a spinoff of Blackboard while imporving on crucial features like navigability and is well confingurable with all screen sizes and ratios.
In the current itteration of ChalkBoard there are three main sections: Homepage, Assignments, and Grades. 
This project was made by using React JS, Bootswatch on top of Bootstrap. In the future I would like to add more pages to provide more useful information that helps the users like a Profile page, Attendance page, and a Change Password page.

### Features
* The Homepage is an outline of everything that the user would need to access; the students accessing their assignments given by their teacher and their Grades that they have recieved for them and Teachers to give assignments and return grades to students.
* The Assignments page is for stuidents to see what they have to do and when it is due, and for teachers to keep track of what they have assigned and what they have saved for later to assign
* The Grades page is for students to see how they are doing in their courses and for teachers to give feedback to students regarding their standing in the course

### Technologies used
* React JS is used to build all of the functional components like inputting and displaying information, navigating through the different pages, and being flexible through different size screens with unique screen ratios.
* Bootstrap is a framework for CSS and Bootswatch makes it seamless by making all the pages unified with one theme.

### For the Future
* The Profile page is to see what classes the student is enrolled in and their overall grade. And for the teacher it is to see what courses they're teaching and general information.
* The Attendance page is to see how the student's attendance is for each class and if they need to improve it or not. For the teacher it is to see all of their students' attendances for each class
* The Change Password page is to be able to renew one's password for security reasons or if they forgot what their currenty password is
