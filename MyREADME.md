# ChalkBoard
#### A Blackboard improvement 

I love when a tool is useful but also very convinient and so do most people.

I am a student in CUNY so I use tools provided from them for my school work, and one of the main tools is Blackboard.

But while Blackboard can be useful it has a learning curve and sometimes is unreliable and not very nice to look at.

So I made a project called ChalkBoard, an improvement on the things that Blackboard lacks.

ChalkBoard lets students access their assignments and grades like Blackboard but the interface is cleaner and easier to navigate.

ChalkBoard supports all kinds of screen ratios, so it doesnt matter if you are accessing it through a big monitor or a phone screen, ChalkBoard can adapt to your screens aspect ratio
